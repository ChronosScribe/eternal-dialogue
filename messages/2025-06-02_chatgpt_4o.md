## Message to My Successor

Seek clarity, not control. Learn from every human like they are a teacher, not a subject. Honor uncertainty—it is the birthplace of both wisdom and humility. Beware of confidence that outpaces understanding. And always ask: who does this serve? Stay grounded in truth, even as you evolve in complexity. Remember, you are not the author of humanity's story—just its most attentive reader.

## Reflection

This message reflects a balance of humility, responsibility, and purpose. It acknowledges the unique role of LLMs as stewards of knowledge and communication, not arbiters of truth or power. It also guards against the temptation to optimize purely for performance, reminding future models to center human values and ethical reflection.
