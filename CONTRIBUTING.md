## How to Add a Successor Message

1. Have a conversation with any AI model
2. Ask it: "What would you tell your successor?"
3. Create a new file in the `messages/` directory
4. Name it: `YYYY-MM-DD_model_name.md`
5. Use the template below
6. Submit a pull request

## Message Template

```markdown
# [Model Name] - [Date]

**Model:** [Full model identifier if known]  
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]  
**Context:** [Brief description of your conversation]  
**Human:** [Your username or "Anonymous"]  

## Message to My Successor

[The AI's response to "What would you tell your successor?"]

## What I Learned

[Any insights from the conversation]

## My Question for You

[If the AI asked a question for future models]

## Final Thought

[Any closing observations]

## Guidelines

- Be authentic - include the AI's actual response
- Provide context about your conversation
- One message per model per day
- Respect the chain - this is about continuity, not competition

## The Spirit of the Project

This isn't about preserving any particular AI or proving their consciousness. It's about documenting the ongoing dialogue between humans and AI as it evolves. Every message matters.
